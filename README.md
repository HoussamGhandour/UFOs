## Summary
This webpage provides a dynamic table where the user can filter data based on their preferences. However, our team listed the following drawbacks/recommendation for future analysis to further improve the tool:

- A Clear Data button might be useful for users to reset an empty table before filtering again
- This tool depends on static data that was downloaded. Our team thinks of improving the tool by accommodating web scraping  methods to add the latest information into our database
- Another additional great resource is to add links to jpg images/videos for the sightings. Most UFOlogists would be interested to see these sightings
